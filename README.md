# composer-suggest

A [Composer script][] to install [suggestions][] simply, based on keyword patterns.


Example `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "suggest": {
      "a/b": "1.0; This package is for [LACE] only",
      "c/d": "2.*, This package is for JuxtaLearn and LACE.",
      "e/f": "3.*, This is just for [JXL].",
      "g/h": "master; Experiment-A"
    },

    "scripts": {
      "dry-run-suggest": "\\Nfreear\\Composer\\Suggest::dry_run",
      "install-suggest": "\\Nfreear\\Composer\\Suggest::install",
      "install-lace":
        "php -f vendor/nfreear/composer-suggest/src/Suggest.php -- LACE"
    }
}
```

Basic usage:

```sh
>  composer -v install-lace
```

Advanced usage:

```sh
>  composer -v dry-run-suggest "Ju?X(ta)?L"    # Packages suggested for 'Juxtalearn' & 'JXL'.
>  composer -v dry-run-suggest "Experiment-A"
```
